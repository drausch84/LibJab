                A Most Unfortunate Day
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p class = "first-part">
                Hello, my name is <span class = "pet-name" id = "ad-lib"></span>.  Today began like any other day, I was rushing down the stairs in a very <span class = "adjective" id = "ad-lib"></span> manner, because I was running late for work.
                I searched frantically for my car keys, which shouldn't be hard to find since I have a <span class = "color" id = "ad-lib"></span> keychain!  I searched for what felt like hours until I finally found them
                underneath a <span class = "rhyme-word" id = "ad-lib"></span>.  As odd as it was to find my keys there, I <span class = "adverb" id = "ad-lib"></span> drank my morning coffee and headed out the door.
                As I ran to my car, I slipped on a puddle and landed right on my <span class ="body-part" id = "ad-lib"></span>!  OUCH!!!!  As I picked myself up, my phone began to ring!  
                It was my boss, <span class ="best-friend-name" id = "ad-lib"></span>.  "<span class = "pet-name" id = "ad-lib"></span>, you're 30 minutes late!!!!!"  "I'm sorry Mr. <span class = "best-friend-name" id = "ad-lib"></span>,
                I'll be there as soon as I can."  "Well, if you aren't here in 15 minutes, consider yourself fired!", Mr. <span class ="best-friend-name" id = "ad-lib"></span> shouted before hanging up on me.
            </p>
            <p class = "second-part">
                I was ready to hop in my car when I noticed that I must have torn my <span class = "clothing" id = "ad-lib"></span> when I slipped on the puddle!  This was most unfortunate considering this <span class = "clothing" id = "ad-lib"></span> was
                from my favorite clothing store, <i><span class = "ice-cream-flavor" id = "ad-lib"></span> Republic</i>.  What really stinks is our town's <i><span class = "ice-cream-flavor" id = "ad-lib"></span> Republic</i> recently shut down
                and the nearest one is in <span class = "us-city" id = "ad-lib"></span>.  No matter, I have to hurry to work before I get fired!  Immediately, upon entering my car, the smell of <span class = "food" id = "ad-lib"></span>s
                filled the air.  Man, I could really go for a <span class = "food" id = "ad-lib"></span> right about now, I thought.  That's when I noticed I was sitting in an entire batch of <span class = "food" id = "ad-lib"></span>s!!!!  
                NO!!!!!!!!  I completely forgot I left them on my driver's seat last night!!!!  No matter, its time to get to work!!  I was driving until I approached a red light at a cross-section of Broadway and Main Street.  Out of the corner of my eye,
                I saw a homeless person juggling crushed beer cans and singing sailor shanties!  Oh wow, that homeless person looks exactly like <span class = "celeb-name" id = "ad-lib"></span>!  Afterwards, the homeless person began to engage in a spirited 
                exhibition of <span class = "recreational-activity" id = "ad-lib"></span>.
            </p>
            <p class = "third-part">
                OK, it's time to get out of here!!!!  I had 10 minutes to make it to work, and I was about 3 miles away.
                "<span class = "funny-phrase" id = "ad-lib"></span>!  This is going to be close!  I knew I had to make it on time, especially considering how <span class = "personality-trait" id = "ad-lib"></span> Mr. <span class ="best-friend-name" id = "ad-lib"></span> is.
                I made it to my company's parking lot with 4 minutes to spare.  I began <span class = "verb" id = "ad-lib"></span> toward the building door.  I was filled with <span class = "emotion" id = "ad-lib"></span> for actually
                making it to work on time.  Upon running toward my office cubical, I was approached by a group of <span class = "plural-noun" id = "ad-lib"></span>.  "Did you hear?", the <span class = "plural-noun" id = "ad-lib"></span> asked me.
                "No, what?", I inquired.  One of the <span class = "plural-noun" id = "ad-lib"></span> began laughing as she told me, "So apparently Mr. <span class ="best-friend-name" id = "ad-lib"></span> was running late for work because he was attacked on his doorstep
                by a rabid <span class = "animal" id = "ad-lib"></span>!"  "Oh my goodness, is he alright?", I asked.  "He's fine, just a few scrapes, but because of that incident, we get to leave home early!"  "<span class = "funny-phrase" id = "ad-lib"></span>!" 
                I shouted, as I headed out of the building.
