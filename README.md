## About the Project
What were the most popular books in the 90s?  Did you guess Goosebumps?  Nancy Drew?  BabySitters Club?  WRONG!!!  It was the Mad Libs Books!  This project will use jQuery to help create a Mad Libs-inspired application where the user will enter different choices such as: Favorite Color, Favorite Food, Name of Your First Pet, etc. and use those choices to create a bizarre and hillarious story!
